			<p>    My name is Margaret Crawford, I'm a first year student at Olin College of Engineering. I'm originally from San Francisco California, and in my spare time I enjoy watching gymnastics and eating good food.</p>
			<p>    This website is a project that I'm using to learn HTML and CSS. I also have experience with Matlab and Python, and I'm learning Java. Some of the projects I've worked on include a program that finds genes in DNA strands, and a facemash style ranking website for goats.</p>

			<p>    My name is Margaret Crawford, I'm a first year student at Olin College of Engineering. I'm originally from San Francisco California, and in my spare time I enjoy watching gymnastics and eating good food.</p>
			<p>    I am currently learning Python, and I have begun learning Java as well. I also have experience with Matlab. I've only started programming this year but I'm trying to learn all I can right now. This website is a project that I'm using to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
